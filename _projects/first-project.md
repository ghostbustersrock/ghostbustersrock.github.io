description: An easy way to log one's monthly expenses and use graphical representations to showcase spending trends.
---

## Overview

I like to keep track of my finances, to make sure I do not step into unnecessary spending habits, but  most importantly, to understand how much money I am saving a month, which could be reinvested into something else (stocks, side business, etc.). Creating this app was very useful for me to not only improve upon my developer skills, but also make my expense tracking much more fun and visual, giving me an immediate understanding of what I am doing right and what I am doing wrong.

## What you can do
- Add/remove expenses (in £) for one or more categories in the current month.
- Visualise a past month's expenses.
- Visualise your total spending every month on a graph, to spot how much more/less you have spent in total. This automatically updates as you input expenses during the current month.
- Select a category to visualise its total changing value between months.

## Tech Used
- Python 3
- FastAPI
- Local PostgreSQL database
- React
- JavaScript

## App Snapshots – !!!TODO!!!


## Future Work
- Improve the UI's design.
- Upload expenses via a CSV file and validate the entries.
- Allow inputting expenses in foreign currencies and converting them to £.
- Allow users to add a note upon adding/removing an expense.
